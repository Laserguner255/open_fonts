# Open Fonts

This module helps you to replace your system fonts though Magisk.

**ATTENTION!** After several attempts I decided to replace only the main Android font: Roboto. This choice is the one I think is more correct as it is left to the user the possibility to choose other fonts without having to uninstall the module.

## Compatibility

- Any Android device with AOSP rom
- Magisk 20.4+

## Tested Device

- Many devices with [LOS](https://lineageos.org/)

## Support

## Features

- Works on any device running AOSP rom with Android 9.0+ and Magisk 20.4+
- Support latest Noto Emoji version ([Unicode 14.0](https://emojipedia.org/unicode-14.0/))
- Replaced Samsung, LG and HTC custom emoji with Noto Emoji
- Fully replaces the system fonts with:
    1. [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans)
    2. [Noto Emoji](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji)
